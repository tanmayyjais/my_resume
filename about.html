    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>

<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Tanmay Jaiswal, and I am a passionate coding enthusiast currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur(2025). I am excited to showcase my skills and experience in data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, and web development.</p>
<ol>
<li>
    <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms:</h2>
    <p>With a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, I possess the ability to analyze complex problems and design efficient solutions. I have honed my skills through various projects and coursework, enabling me to tackle challenges with creativity and precision. I enjoy exploring different data structures and algorithms to optimize performance and deliver robust solutions.</p>
    <h3>Projects:-</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <h4>ANALYSIS OF THE INDIAN STOCK MARKET</h4>
        <p>Worked on a data analytic solution to draw various inferences for Indian stock market, and using file handling to access the data of various stocks and various functions such as calculating the best performing stock, and more using arrays, structures, strings, and pointers in C.</p>
    </li> 
    <li>
        <h4>Student-Assignment Management Software System</h4>
        <p>Worked on a solution to manage data of studentsâ€™ assignments and their submissions where exactly two students can form a group and work on the same assignment, such as submission status, update marks of submitted assignments, change submission status using singly linked list as data structure and file handling. Also worked on this solution using AVL Trees as data structure.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
    <h2>Object-Oriented Programming:</h2>
    <p>I have a deep understanding of object-oriented programming principles, which allows me to develop modular and scalable applications. By leveraging the power of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, I can create elegant and maintainable code. I am proficient in languages such as Java, Python, and C++, utilizing their object-oriented paradigms to build robust and flexible software solutions.</p>
    <h3>Projects:-</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Banking System</h4>
            <p>Used concepts of object oriented programming to create a program which uses file handling to take and store account details and provides various functions like create an account, cash withdrawal, deposit, delete an existing account and so on. It has a very basic functionality as compared to a real bank application but it has covered the concepts of object oriented programming effectively.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Web Development (Basic):</h2>
<p>Alongside my core programming skills, I have ventured into web development, where I have acquired a solid foundation. While my expertise in this area is still developing, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am enthusiastic about creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I strive to enhance my skills in this field, incorporating modern frameworks and technologies to deliver engaging web experiences.</p>
<h3>Projects:-</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="./4.3 HTML Porfolio Project/index.html">HTML Portofolio</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Passion for Coding:</h3>
<p>Coding is not merely a career choice for me; it is my true passion. I find joy in the process of problem-solving, transforming complex challenges into elegant solutions through code. I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow, staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in the ever-evolving world of programming.</p>

<h4>Why Hire Me?</h4>
<p>When you hire me, you gain a dedicated and motivated individual who is committed to delivering high-quality work. I thrive in a collaborative environment and enjoy working as part of a team to achieve common goals. With my strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and passion for coding, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to any project.</p>

<p>I am excited to embark on new opportunities, take on challenging projects, and make a positive impact through my coding expertise. If you are looking for a skilled and enthusiastic programmer to join your team, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Let's work together to bring your ideas to life!</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.</p>
<p>P.S. : I'll be providing the links to my projects very soon. Stay updated!</p>
